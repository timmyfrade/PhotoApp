# About The Project - PhotoApp

First of all, I would like to thank Holiday Extras for this amazing opportunity. I really hope you like the project. I did my best and worked really hard to deliver this amazing react app I created.

I took the liberty in creating an app that is focused on Alternative Photography, something that is actually related with my background studies and it's a way I found to share the beautiful world of Alternative Photographic Processes. 

In this app, it's possible to search for different content by tag and it's suitable for all ages. In each photo it is possible to click on the title and authorname to access it's respective link (title for photo and owner for author profile). It is also possible to load more content while the user scrolls.
This app is also mobile friendly.

About the Dockerfile:

I don't have much experience working with Docker, but somehow I was able to create a file and all the necessary commands. If it's not working as expected, I am sorry in advance. 

Thank you once again for the opportunity! I hope we can meet in the future!
